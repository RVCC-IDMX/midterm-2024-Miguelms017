Dear Prof. Carusso.

I'm writing to you because at the time i'm writing this letter, I already submit the code by using the midterm template I found inside the github course.

Anyway, Ill copy the code I've made in this repo. if you want to check the commit comments, you can visit the first Github repo at https://github.com/Miguelms017/Miguelms017-midterm . This repo is public and you won't have problems to check it.

If you find any problem you can send me an email at g00301640@stu.raritanval.edu or miguelmartinez030205@gmail.com.

Thanks for reading and I'm sorry the inconvenients.

Sincerely:
Miguel M
